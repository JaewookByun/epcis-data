## GEODES Project

> GEODES Project, GS1-Enriched Open Data and EPCIS System, is a project for facilitating the usage of GS1 standards especially EPCIS.  

> EPCIS is a de-facto standard, ratified by an international standardization organization - GS1, for capturing and sharing crucial events and master data of everyday-objects. All the events and master data, captured by barcode and RFID reader powered by GS1's identifier standard, can be represented in a consistent and standard way. Thus, understanding the standards enables non-experts and experts in software to work together and make common consent for the understanding of the data.  

> We hope GEODES to be 'geodes', which producing high-quality crystals from quartz by resolving obstacles for its global interoperability.
